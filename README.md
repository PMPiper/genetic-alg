# genetic-alg

Visualization of the getetic algorithm.
Dots follow a randomly generated set of steps to reach a goal.

Initial parameter values, pop_size=15, brain_size=75, mutation_rate=0.1. An increase of the population and brain size will affect performance in this version. The range of the for loop in main.py defines the number of generations.
